Description: fluxcapacitor is a quantitative backtesting engine that plays nicely within the tidyverse.
    The package gets its name from the Back to the Future series of films -- like the flux capacitor in
    Doc Brown's DeLorean, this package aims to facilitate "time travel", allowing financial researchers to
    simulate the results of trading strategies.
